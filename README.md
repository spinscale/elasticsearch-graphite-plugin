# Elasticsearch graphite plugin

This plugin creates a little push service, which regularly updates a graphite host with indices stats and nodes stats. In case you are running a cluster, these datas are always only pushed from the master node.

The data sent to the graphite server tries to be roughly equivalent to [Indices Stats API](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/admin-indices-stats.html) and [Nodes Stats Api](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/admin-cluster-nodes-stats.html)


## Installation

As plugins (except site plugins) cannot be automatically installed from github currently you need to build the plugin yourself (takes half a minute including an integrations test).

```
git clone https://github.com/spinscale/elasticsearch-graphite-plugin
cd elasticsearch-graphite-plugin
mvn package
/path/to/elasticsearch/bin/plugin -install graphite -url file:///absolute/path/to/current/dir/target/releases/elasticsearch-plugin-graphite-0.1-SNAPSHOT.zip
```


## Configuration

Configuration is possible via three parameters:

* `metrics.graphite.host`: The graphite host to connect to (default: none)
* `metrics.graphite.port`: The port to connect to (default: 2003)
* `metrics.graphite.every`: The interval to push data (default: 1m)
* `metrics.graphite.prefix`: The metric prefix that's sent with metric names (default: elasticsearch.your_cluster_name)

Check your elasticsearch log file for a line like this after adding the configuration parameters below to the configuration file

```
[2013-02-08 16:01:49,153][INFO ][service.graphite         ] [Sea Urchin] Graphite reporting triggered every [1m] to host [graphite.example.com:2003]
```


## Bugs/TODO

* No really nice cluster support yet (needed it for a single instance system)
* Not extensively tested
* In case of a master node failover, counts are starting from 0 again (in case you are wondering about spikes)
